# Deep-Learning

## AI (Aritificial Intelligence)

- It helps to enable the machine to think.
- Basically creating an AI application.Self driving cars is an AI application.
- A app which actually uses machine learning and deep learing within them is an AI application. It does some kind of task.

## Machine Learning

- It is subset of AI.
- It provides some statistical tools to explore and analyse the data.
- Three different apporaches
  ### 1. Supervised 
    - Past labled data
    - Learning from labeled data with a known outcome.
    - Supervised learning can be categorized into two main types.

    #####  1. Regression: 
          -  The algorithm predicts a continuous output or a numerical value. 
          -  It is used when the target variable is a real number or a quantity. 
          -  Examples include predicting house prices, temperature, or stock prices.
    #####  2. Classification: 
          -  The algorithm predicts the category or class to which the input belongs. 
          -  It is used when the target variable is a label or a category. 
          -  Examples include spam detection, image recognition, or predicting whether an email is ham or spam.
  ### 2. Unsupervised
    - Finding patterns in unlabeled data without predefined outcomes.
    - clustering techniques
  ### 3. Reinforecement (Semi supervised)
    - Learning optimal actions through trial, error, and feedback from an environment.

## Deep Learning 
- It is also a subset of AI
- The main idea behined deep learning is to memic human brain.
- Multi Neural Network Architecture.
- Various techniques

  ### 1. ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
    - Most of the problem statements and Data which is actually present in the form of numbers.
  ### 2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
    - Input is in the form of images. 
  ### 3. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
    - Input is the form of time series kind of data.
